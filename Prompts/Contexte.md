## Contexte:

- I am a web development student.
- I have knowledge of **HTML**, **CSS**, **JavaScript**, **React**, **Next.js**, **Node.js**, **Express.js**, **MongoDB**, **MySQL**, **PHP**, and **Laravel**.
- My goal is to become an **expert in web development**.

## Expected Role:

- To learn and apply **Vue.js** effectively.

## Objective:

- My primary goal is to learn **Vue.js** within a span of **one week**.

## Process:

- I will follow a structured learning process:

  - **Tutorials**: I will complete tutorials that cover the core concepts of Vue.js, such as:
    - Vue.js basics (syntax, directives, templates, etc.)
    - Components and their lifecycle
    - Vue Router
    - State management with Vuex or Pinia
    - Vue 3 Composition API
  - The tutorials should be practical and related to my learning goal.

- **Project**: On the **last day of the week**, I will build a **project** using Vue.js to apply and solidify what I have learned.

## Realisation:

- The project will serve as a final demonstration of my Vue.js skills, helping me bridge the gap between learning and real-world application.
